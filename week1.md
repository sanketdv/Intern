        • Got my laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad) and task was to create a bootable drive to format the laptop. Researched from website https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview suggested by Amit Sir. But challenged occurs as rufus isn't available for macbook, so scrolled through various youtube videos and tackle the challenge by knowning the alternative of rufus for mac as balenaecther. But it was taking too much time to download so one of my colleague Udit gave me a bootable drive to format the laptop. But as promised to Amit Sir, I've learned how to create a bootable drive.

Scrolled an youtube video (https://youtu.be/7-naqq9fvZE?si=0iJ5ndybp1R183Lu), it helped me install and anaconda got downloaded, but while initailising it, terminal shows anaconda not available. Tried the technique stated in video multiple time but nothing happened. So change the video (https://youtu.be/6i8Bf9Xv9C0?si=NylXPISOtJ02UTmd) and tried that technique and got through. Both Anaconda and Python libraries got download.
